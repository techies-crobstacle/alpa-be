## 1. Overview & Concept

When a customer places an order, the platform automatically records a **Commission Earned** entry for every seller whose products appear in that order. Each record tracks:

- **Order Value** — the seller's gross share (their items × quantity)
- **Commission Amount** — the platform fee deducted (e.g. 10%)
- **Net Payable** — the amount the seller is owed (`orderValue − commissionAmount`)

Previously, net payable amounts simply accumulated with a manual admin `PAID` mark. With this feature, sellers can **actively request payouts** against their available ("redeemable") balance through their dashboard.

**Key rules:**
- Payout eligibility is tied to a **30-day holding period** — only commission records from orders placed 30 or more days ago count towards the redeemable balance.
- A seller can only have **one open (PENDING) payout request** at a time.
- A seller may request a **partial amount** (up to their full redeemable balance) or leave the amount blank to request the full redeemable balance.
- All amounts are in **AUD**.

---

## 2. The 30-Day Eligibility Rule

Every `commission_earned` record has a `createdAt` timestamp set when the order was placed. The redeemable split works as follows:

```
Total Net Payable (PENDING)
        │
        ├── created_at ≤ 30 days ago  →  redeemableAmount  ✅ Can request payout
        └── created_at > 30 days ago  →  lockedAmount       🔒 Not yet eligible
```

**Example:**

| Order | Order Date | Net Payable | Eligible? |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| #1    | Jan 1     | $90.00      | ✅ Yes    |
| #2    | Jan 5     | $90.00      | ✅ Yes    |
| #3    | Jan 10    | $90.00      | ✅ Yes    |
| #4    | Feb 25    | $90.00      | ✅ Yes    |
| #5    | Feb 28    | $90.00      | ✅ Yes    |
| #6    | Mar 3     | $90.00      | 🔒 Locked |
| #7    | Mar 5     | $90.00      | 🔒 Locked |
| #8    | Mar 7     | $90.00      | 🔒 Locked |
| #9    | Mar 9     | $90.00      | 🔒 Locked |
| #10   | Mar 10    | $90.00      | 🔒 Locked |

> As of today (March 10, 2026), orders #1–#5 are 30+ days old.

| Field               | Value    |
|---------------------|----------|
| Total Net Payable   | $900.00  |
| **Redeemable Now**  | **$450.00** ✅ |
| Locked (< 30 days)  | $450.00 🔒 |

The seller can request a payout of **up to $450.00** today. The remaining $450.00 will unlock progressively as each order's 30-day hold expires.

---

## 3. How the Payout Cycle Works

```
Order placed → commission_earned record created
               status = PENDING, created_at = now()
                           │
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              │ < 30 days old           │ ≥ 30 days old
              │ lockedAmount 🔒         │ redeemableAmount ✅
              └────────────┬────────────┘
                           │
             Seller views redeemable balance
             GET /api/commissions/payout/redeemable
                           │
             Seller submits payout request
             POST /api/commissions/payout/request
             { requestedAmount: 450.00 }  ← optional (defaults to full redeemable)
                           │
             payout_requests record created
             status = PENDING
                           │
             ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
             │                            │
         Admin APPROVES              Admin REJECTS
         (in-review / confirmed)     (with reason)
             │                            │
             │                     Seller notified
             ▼                     (status = REJECTED)
         Admin transfers funds externally
         (bank transfer to seller's registered bank account)
             │
         Admin marks COMPLETED
         PUT /api/admin/commissions/payout-requests/:id/status
         { status: "COMPLETED" }
             │
             ▼
         All eligible commission_earned rows for that seller
         automatically marked PAID ✅
```

> **Important:** The platform does **not** execute bank transfers automatically. Admin must complete the transfer externally and then mark the request as `COMPLETED`.

## 4. Seller Endpoints

> All seller endpoints require a user with role `SELLER`.

### 4.1 `GET /api/commissions/payout/redeemable`

Returns the seller's current balance split — total pending, redeemable (eligible for payout), locked, and total already paid. Also returns any open payout request so the UI can prevent duplicate submissions.

---

### 5.2 `PUT /api/admin/commissions/payout-requests/:id/status`

Update the status of a payout request. Use this to progress a request through the workflow.

**Path Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | The payout request ID |

**Request Body**

```json
{
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "adminNote": "Paid via ANZ transfer on 12 March 2026"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Yes | One of: `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `COMPLETED` |
| `adminNote` | string | No | Note visible to admin (e.g. transfer reference) |

**Valid Status Transitions**

```
PENDING → APPROVED    (admin confirms they will process it)
PENDING → REJECTED    (admin declines with a reason — include adminNote)
APPROVED → COMPLETED  (admin has transferred funds externally)
PENDING → COMPLETED   (shortcut — skip APPROVED if processing immediately)
```

**Example Request**

```http
PUT /api/admin/commissions/payout-requests/pr_abc123/status
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "adminNote": "Paid via ANZ bank transfer — ref TXN98765"
}
```

**Example Response `200 OK`**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payout request marked as COMPLETED"
}
```

> **Auto-PAID side effect on COMPLETED:** When a request is marked `COMPLETED`, the server automatically marks every eligible `commission_earned` record for that seller (status = `PENDING` and created 30+ days ago) as `PAID`. No manual action required.

**Validation**

| Scenario | Status | Message |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Invalid status value | `400` | "status must be one of: APPROVED, REJECTED, COMPLETED" |
| Payout request ID not found | `404` | "Payout request not found" |

## 9. UI Implementation Guide

### Seller Dashboard

#### Earnings / Wallet Card (Header)

Call `GET /api/commissions/payout/redeemable` on page load. Build a card like:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  My Earnings                                                         │
│                                                                      │
│  Total Pending     Redeemable Now    Locked          Total Paid      │

│                                                                      │
│  Eligible orders: 5                                                  │
│                                                                      │
│  [  Request Payout  ]   ← disabled if redeemableAmount = 0          │
│                         ← disabled if pendingPayoutRequest != null   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Disable** the "Request Payout" button if:
  - `redeemableAmount === 0` → show tooltip: *"No orders are eligible yet — amounts unlock 30 days after the order date."*
  - `pendingPayoutRequest !== null` → show tooltip: *"You already have a pending payout request."*

#### Request Payout Modal

```

#### Payout Request Detail / Action Panel

When admin clicks a row, show a side panel or modal with:

  ```
  Bank:           ANZ
  Account Name:   Jane Doe

| `COMPLETED` | Read-only |

- When marking `COMPLETED`, prompt admin to add a transfer reference as the `adminNote`
- After a successful `COMPLETED` action, show a confirmation: *"X commission record(s) have been automatically marked as PAID."*

#### Summary Stats Card

Add to the existing commission summary cards:

```
┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐
│  Pending Payout  │  │ Approved Payout  │  │ Completed Today  │
│  Requests        │  │ Requests         │  │                  │
│       7          │  │       3          │  │      $1,230.00   │
└──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘  └──────────────────┘
```

These counts can be derived by calling `GET /api/admin/commissions/payout-requests?status=PENDING` and `?status=APPROVED` on page load.
